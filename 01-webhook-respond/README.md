# 01 – Basic Webhook Response 🚀

This workflow demonstrates a simple *Webhook → Respond to Webhook* automation.  
When a request is sent to the webhook URL, n8n replies with a custom JSON message.

## 📂 Nodes
- *Webhook (GET)* → Trigger on incoming request  
- *Respond to Webhook* → Send back a JSON response

## 🛠️ Use Case
Useful as a starting point for testing n8n setup, webhooks, or learning the basics.
